<h1>Assignment 7 - Javascript</h1>

<ol>
	<li><b>Find a few tutorials on the web for learning Javascript.</b>
		You don't have to read them.
		Just make sure you know where you can go to learn what you need.
		</li><br><br>

	<li>Play around with <a href="turtle.html">this page</a>.
		It uses Javascript to implement that turtle program that you made in assignment 2.
		View the source of this page (Ctrl-U in most browsers).
		<br><img src="turtle.png">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="lettuce.png"><br>
		Study the code until you feel that you understand it reasonably well.
		Add comments to the code to help organize your understanding.
		<br><br>
		Here are a few technical details worth noting:<br><br>
		<ul>
			<li>Javascript is a dynamically typed language.
				It has no compiler to help you catch bugs.
				There is, however, a pretty decent debugger built into your browser.
				You will need to use it.
			</li><br><br>
			<li>The two lines that are not inside any function are executed immediately as the page is loaded into your browser.
			</li><br><br>
			<li>The <font color="green">getElementById</font> function returns an object that represents an element in the HTML DOM.
				This script deliberately comes after the <font color="green">&lt;canvas&gt;</font> tag,
				so the line <font color="green">document.getElementById("myCanvas");</font> will succeed at finding it.
			</li><br><br>
			<li>By convention, classes begin with a capital letter and methods begin with a lowercase letter.
				In Javascript, as of ES6, there are classes, but you can also use functions to represent classes. <i>Feel free to skip to the next part if you're just going to use the class keyword... </i><br><br>
				If you choose to use a function, you should capitalize the name to indicate it is intended to be called as a constructor.<br><br>
				"prototype" is like a class object. All objects of a particular type refer to the same prototype object.
				So, when you add a method to the prototype object, it becomes accessible by all objects of that type.
				<br><br>
				tl;dr:<br><br>
				<font color="green">"function Model() {"</font> pretty much means <font color="green">"class Model {"</font>.<br><br>
				<font color="green">"Model.prototype.update = function() {"</font> pretty much means <font color="green">"method update() {"</font>.
			</li><br><br>
			<li>The line, <font color="green">this.turtle.src = "turtle.png";</font> causes the browser to request the turtle.png image.
				However, it make take some time before that image actually arrives.
				Until then, the image will be blank.
			</li><br><br>
			<li>This code uses "closures" in the calls to <font color="green">addEventListener</font> and <font color="green">setInterval</font>.
				Essentially, these calls expect simple functions, but we want to call class methods,
				so we pass a wrapper function that calls the method.
				These wrapper functions have access to the local variables because they retain a reference to
				the current stack frame, which keeps it alive even after the outer function returns.
			</li><br><br>
		</ul>
		</li><br><br>

	<li><b>Port your implementation of assignment 5 to Javascript</b>.<br>
		Your game should include all the major features of assignment 5, including Mario, tubes, Goombas, fireballs, and collision detection.
		</li><br><br>

	<li><b>Submit a zip file in the usual manner</b>
		The zip file should contain your HTML file and image files. Test your zip file before you submit it by extracting into a separate folder and then opening your web page from that new folder. Ensure that it works (in Chrome) as expected, especially finding all images as necessary.
	</li><br><br>
</ol>




<br><br><br><br><h2>General Rubric (subject to change as needed)</h2>
	You should submit all necessary files through Blackboard in a zip file named "<b><font color="red">Assignment7.zip</font></b>".  When the grader opens your file, they should find:
	<ul>
		<li>A web page containing a Mario game written in Javascript.</li>
		<li>It should include a Mario, at least two tubes, and a goomba.</li>
		<li>When you press the arrow keys, the tubes should scroll. When you press space, Mario should jump.</li>
		<li>Mario and the goombas should be able to interact with the tubes as if they were solid objects.</li>
		<li>Mario should be able to throw fireballs, which bounce as expected and interact with goombas (who will catch on fire and disappear after a set amount of time)</li>
		<li>Goombas should move of their own accord, bouncing between tubes.</li>
	</ul>
	If you meet these requirements, you should expect full credit (minus any late penalty).




<br><br><br><br><h2>FAQ:</h2>
<ol>
	<li><b>Q: The page mentioned in step 2 doesn't work in my browser. What should I do?</b><br>
		A: Do you have a really old browser? Try replacing all occurrences of "let" with "var". Does that fix it? If not, please update your browser.  If that still doesn't fix it, please contact me.
		</li><br><br>

	<li><b>Q: Would you please post all the information we will need about Javascript here, so we don't have to use a search engine?</b><br>
		A: No.
		</li><br><br>

	<li><b>Q: Is there an ArrayList type in Javascript?</b><br>
		A: No. Use an Array.
		</li><br><br>

	<li><b>Q: How would one remove the i<sup>th</sup> element from an array in Javascript?</b><br>
		A: arr.splice(i, 1);
		</li><br><br>

	<li><b>Q: How do you detect right-click, since the browser intercepts right-clicks for its own purposes?</b><br>
		A: See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4235426/how-can-i-capture-the-right-click-event-in-javascript">this</a>.
<pre class="code">
view.canvas.addEventListener(
		"contextmenu",
		function(event) {
			event.preventDefault();
			self.onRightClick(event);
			return false;
		},
		false
	);
